Show money at the top, with the stats on the top right corner, and the title on the left

The height of the money should be the same as the height of all of the stats on top of each other.

The side bar should have trees of options for categories, and all.

The shopping side should also include the "year" or Era.

Show only the icons when in mobile. Hide the text. The icons are square.









The computer speed should come before modems, so you have to buy new modems when they come out.
