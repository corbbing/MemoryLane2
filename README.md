##What's changed since Version 1 (if you played ML1)

###Added Bootstrap 4

The interface looks clean, professional, readable and cohesive.



###Constant download speed

It used to be that it would download everything at the same rate. Now it's divided equally among the downloads.

###Upgrade versions, "software requirements"

Now, when you download software, it will reach a max version, and you won't be able to upgrade it further. This means, you have to download carefully and strategically, and get rid of software.

###Computers

You now have a limit to how fast you download things. It's not just click to upgrade. Upgrade too much and it's useless.

###Money

Sell things to buy new things. Do research, sell software, sell hardware. What you do is up to you.

###A purpose

MemoryLane is not about downloading stuff to unlock new stuff to download. It's so much more! It's about history, it's about exploring the dark ages of the internet, it's about learning your roots, and most of all, it's about knowing your limits, and breaking through them!
